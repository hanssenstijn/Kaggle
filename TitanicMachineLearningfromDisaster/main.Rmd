### Clear working space
First step is to make sure that the working space is empty.
```{r}
# clear all variables
rm(list=ls()) 
```

### Load packages
Loading the required packages for specific functions.
```{r}
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(GLDEX)
```

### Set working directory
Choose the path were the data-sets are stored
```{r}
DATA.DIR <- "~/GitHub/Kaggle/TitanicMachineLearningfromDisaster"
setwd(DATA.DIR)
# See which files are in WD
list.files() 
```

### Import data
The training and test set will be imported into R
```{r}
train <- read.csv("train.csv",stringsAsFactors = F,header = T)
test <- read.csv("test.csv", stringsAsFactors =  F,header = T)
```

### Inspect training data
Firstly we look at the data structure, to see which variables we have. 
```{r}
str(train)
summary(train)
head(train)
tail(train)
```
